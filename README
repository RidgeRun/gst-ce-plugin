This is a GStreamer plugin for Texas Instruments SoC platforms using the CodecEngine API.

This plugin is a follow up project developed by RidgeRun to the gst-dmai-plugin available
from http://gstreamer.ti.com, that adds support for the GStreamer 1.0 API and merges the
design concepts from the ddompe branch into a refactored design.

The main difference from previous projects is the use of the newer GStreamer APIs.

Currently this projects targets support for the following platforms:
- DM36x

If you need support for other SoC, contact RidgeRun for support.
